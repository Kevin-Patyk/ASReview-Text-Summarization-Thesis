238,Cognitive and affective trait and state factors influencing the long-term symptom course in remitted depressed patients,10.1371/journal.pone.0178759,1,article9339, method we followed up remitted depressed individuals six and months after baseline clinical outcomes were time to relapse time spent with significant symptoms as a marker of chronicity and levels of depressive symptoms at t and t predictors assessed at baseline included residual symptoms and trait rnt furthermore momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment results in multiple models residual symptoms and instability of daily life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse while chronicity was significantly predicted by trait rnt multilevel models revealed that depressive symptom levels during follow up were predicted by baseline residual symptom levels and by instability of daily life rumination both instability features were linked to a higher number of anamnestic mdd episodes introduction major depressive disorder is a highly prevalent mental disorder characterized by a high risk of chronicity and relapse in light of the unfavorable long term course of mdd it is important to identify risk factors that contribute to the clinical course of the disorder in previous studies clinical characteristics such as the number of previous episodes and subclinical residual symptoms have been identified as relevant course modifiers less is known about the influence of maladaptive habitual cognitive thinking on the long term course of depression first evidence suggests that rumination a cognitive trait defined as a negative pattern of responding to distress by repetitively and passively focusing on the meanings causes and consequences of one s depressive symptoms predicts symptom severity as well as a chronic symptom course in depression maladaptive habitual thinking styles like rumination or worry are subordinate constructs of the broader concept of trait repetitive negative thinking rnt is defined as repeatedly occurring uncontrollable negative and abstract thoughts from which it is difficult to disengage and has been considered to represent a potential transdiagnostic cognitive risk factor for various mental disorders studies suggest that trait rnt is cross sectionally associated with symptoms and treatment outcomes of depression and anxiety only one study so far has identified the predictive validity of rnt for the year course of depressive symptoms in a nonclinical sample comparable data in clinically depressed samples is still missing in contrast to macro level risk factors such as trait rnt possible dysfunctional cognitive and affective momentary state variables reflect mental states at the micro level of moment tomoment experiencing during daily life the investigation of such momentary experiences and their variability over the day appears important because there is increasing evidence that they may affect the course of psychopathology at the macro level a promising approach to examine micro level risk factors in depression is ambulatory assessment here individual data is repeatedly collected over a given period of time and in different contexts during aa individuals rate their affective states and current thoughts or activities thereby it is possible to assess state like vulnerability factors in a naturalistic context and to investigate their predictive value for the future course of illness several studies have investigated affective state variables showing that mdd patients report less positive and more negative affect in daily life compared to healthy controls recent efforts undertaken to test predictive effects of momentary affective processes on the course of depression yielded compelling results substantiating that individual responses to stressful and rewarding events during daily life are associated with future depressive symptoms in addition depressive individuals seem to display a distinct affective dynamic over the day mood instability has predominantly been studied in patients with other psychopathology such as those with borderline personality disorder but first evidence suggests that for example variations in negative affect may also have detrimental effects on the clinical course and treatment response in mdd furthermore by applying a dynamic system framework we could previously show that high entropy i e frequent and unpredictable changes in the interplay between momentary mood and rumination was related to an increase of depressive symptoms during six months in remitted depressed individuals there is a clear lack of aa studies investigating momentary cognitive processes as a potential course modifying vulnerability factor one such possibly important cognitive momentary risk factor is daily life rumination up to now momentary rumination has been predominantly examined in non clinical samples thereby demonstrating an increase in depressive symptoms e g sleep disturbances or negative affect over a short period furthermore depressive symptoms in a student sample were predicted by the level of momentary rumination compared to control participants clinically depressed and anxious individuals are characterized by higher levels of momentary rumination in a previous study we found that momentary rumination was associated with higher cortisol secretion over the day in rmdd individuals demonstrating prolonged activation of the bodily stress system in response to rumination with possible detrimental effects on the further course of depression however studies explicitly investigating the impact of momentary rumination and its instability over the day on the long term course of depression in clinical samples are lacking in summary it appears of high importance to investigate the possible predictive value of both trait rnt and momentary affective and cognitive states during daily life for the longterm course of depression therefore the present study aimed to test the predictive validity of such traits and states at baseline on course related outcomes i e time to relapse chronicity and levels of depressive symptoms over three years in individuals with rmdd although clinical predictors were not the focus of the study we chose to additionally include residual symptom levels at baseline which are considered a potent clinical predictor for relapse and other poor outcomes in depression and which also overlap with other clinical predictors such as the severity of the previous index episode based on previous research showing that both high entropy and variability in daily life affect appears to be linked to an increase in depressive symptoms in rmdd individuals we expected that a fluctuating course would be predominantly predicted by instability measures of daily life affect and cognition up to now these variability measures have not been tested for the more stringent criteria of relapse in contrast first evidence suggests a link between habitual rumination and a chronic symptom course leading to the hypothesis that chronicity and symptom level outcomes would predominantly be predicted by trait rnt methods procedure participants were recruited by announcements in local newspapers and on the homepage of the central institute of mental health mannheim germany after a telephone prescreening preliminary eligible participants were invited to the cimh and a trained clinical psychologist administered the structured clinical interview for dsm iv axis i as part of the baseline interview to assess in and exclusion criteria all rmdd individuals had to fulfill either the criteria for at least two lifetime mdd episodes or a previous chronic mdd of at least two years duration at t they had to be remitted from the last episode i e did not fulfill the criteria of a major depressive episode according to dsm iv for at least two months exclusion criteria were non affective psychotic disorders bipolar disorder substance dependence current substance abuse generalized anxiety disorder and current obsessive compulsive posttraumatic stress and eating disorder according to dsm iv in addition to rmdd participants the study also recruited healthy individuals which are howerver not subject to the present analyses demographic clinical and cognitive trait predictors in rmdd individuals were assessed at t followed by ambulatory assessment of affective and cognitive state factores assessed during the days immediately following the diagnostic baseline interview follow ups on the course of clinical depression and depressive symptoms took place at six and months after baseline and were conducted by a trained clinical psychologist during a telephone interview at all measurement points we assessed diagnostic status and symptom levels and at t and t the course of depression since the last assessment importantly the present study sample of rmdd participants consisted of two consecutively recruited subsamples from an overarching study the two subsamples underwent different functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments conducted after the ambulatory assessment days which are not subject to the present analyses in addition the aa of subsample was restricted to the assessment of naturally occurring mood and rumination over the day whereas in subsample an additional rumination versus mindful self focus manipulation during aa was conducted the two aa procedures are described in the supporting information together with detailed analyses regarding the comparability of subsample and and the legitimation for their combined inclusion for the present long term analyses the study was in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee of the university of heidelberg all participants gave written informed consent sample recruitment and attrition originally individuals were contacted during the telephone prescreening of whom eight participants were excluded n declined to participate at the diagnostic baseline session individuals were excluded due to diagnostic exclusion criteria resulting in a sample of n remitted depressed individuals with whom the comprehensive baseline assessment was carried out of those one participant dropped out after t and eight individuals dropped out after t consequently of initially recruited participants provided data for all measurement points and were included in the present analyses demographic and clinical characteristics at study entry did not differ significantly between participants participating in both follow ups and those who dropped out during the study with one exception there was a significant dropout of participants with lower education levels in contrast individuals who completed the study and those who dropped out did not differ with regard to clinical variables at t outcome measures the following three outcome measures related to the course of illness were investigated time to relapse chronicity and depressive symptom levels the current diagnostic status at all measurement points was determined with the scid i if an individual met criteria for a current major depressive episode during the follow up assessments we coded the number of weeks since the beginning of the current episode additionally we coded the number of weeks related to the beginning and ending of those depressive episodes occurring exclusively during the follow up intervals thereby we assessed both pure interval episodes during the t t and t t intervals and episodes that were present at t and t time to relapse for the outcome time to relapse we calculated the number of weeks to the first mde after t relapse was defined as the recurrence of a depressive syndrome fulfilling criteria of a mdd after t this term was used as an umbrella term for relapses and recurrences due to the limited sample size we combined these two outcomes to increase statistical power chronicity chronicity was defined as the percentage of weeks spent with significant symptoms after t using the information of the expanded scid i at t and t depressive symptom levels as a measure of levels and course of depressive symptoms we used the self rated beck depression inventory revised and the interviewerrated montgomery and asberg depression rating scale which both have shown good reliability validity and sensitivity to symptom changes for statistical analysis we calculated an overall composite score for depressive symptoms by averaging the zstandardized bdi ii and madrs scores both at t and t as done in previous research predictor variables demographic and clinical variables demographic variables included age gender and education status clinical variables included residual depressive symptoms at baseline and current use of medication at t depressive symptoms at t were calculated as a composite score of the madrs and the bdi ii scores trait repetitive negative thinking trait repetitive negative thinking was measured with the perseverative thinking questionnaire which is conceptualized as a content independent measure of rnt individuals are asked how they typically think about negative experiences or problems research has shown that the ptq has good psychometric properties i e internal consistency stability factor structure and construct validity affective and cognitive state variables after the baseline interview affective and cognitive state variables were assessed by aa during the following days in subsample participants were assessed with personal digital assistants and the software izybuilder over two consecutive weekdays with ten assessments per day aa in subsample was conducted over four consecutive weekdays with ten assessments per day using smartphones and the software myexperienceide by movisens gmbh the two subsamples completed identical affective and cognitive aa measures momentary mood was measured with six bipolar items specifically developed for aa that were collapsed into the three scales valence calmness and energetic arousal three items were recoded so that higher values indicate a more positive mood component these subjective mood scales have shown good reliability and validity momentary ruminative self focus was operationalized with the average score of two items developed by moberly and watkins at the moment i am thinking about my problems and at the moment i am thinking about my feelings these items proved to be suitable for studies with aa designs fig shows the overall study design statistical analyses for the aa predictors we used aggregated scores i e overall means over the respective assessment days of the momentary scales together with their averaged instability scores the latter were calculated according to von neumann and collegues using the mean squared successive difference mssd x x n i x i x i n the mssd represents instabilities in a time series as an average of all squared successive changes over time thereby mssd takes into account three components of instability temporal order amplitude and frequency of change a high mssd score reflects high temporal instability as a result of high amplitudes and high frequency of e g mood swings over the day corresponding to low temporal dependency mssd is highly correlated with the standard deviation however compared to variability defined as the dispersion of scores from a central tendency mssd takes into account gradual shifts in means over time for example while the variability of the mood component energetic arousal would be similar for a person with two extreme states of energetic arousal in the morning and evening compared to a person with frequent less extreme swings of energetic arousal over the day mssd reflects these differences mssds were calculated for each momentary mood component and for momentary rumination for each outcome we present the results of simple regression analyses i e the association between outcome and each predictor separately in a first step to determine the independent contribution of each predictor we then entered those predictors with a p value of simultaneously into a multiple model using backward elimination of predictors and retained all predictors in the model that significantly contributed to the respective outcome effects of predictors on time to relapse were estimated using cox regressions to predict chronicity we applied linear regression analyses with the percentage of weeks spent with significant symptoms as the dependent variable this outcome was positively skewed and therefore log transformed to yield a better approximation of a normal distribution effects on depressive symptom levels were analyzed by hierarchical linear models with depressive composite scores at t and t as outcome for the latter analyses we first tested main effects of individual predictors and their interaction effect with time in separate regression models if the interaction term did not reach statistical significance we removed this term from the respective models in a next step we included all significant predictors and significant interaction effects in a multiple model in all multiple models described above subsample status was included as a covariate to control for possible confounding effects of this variable all statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software ibm spss version results participants characteristics demographic clinical as well as cognitive trait and state characteristics are presented in table the mean age at mdd onset in rmdd participants was years and of these individuals reported at least lifetime mdd episodes upon entering the study during the year follow up period of the originally remitted depressed patients had suffered at least one relapse into a major depressive episode furthermore the mean proportion of weeks spent with significant symptoms during the year interval was with spending more than of the weeks with significant symptoms predictors of time to relapse simple cox regression analyses revealed that higher levels of residual depressive symptoms as well as higher instability of momentary rumination and of valence predicted a shorter time to relapse we further conducted correlational analyses on the relationship between number of previous episodes and predictors the respective coefficients are r for residual symptoms r for instability of momentary valence and r for instability of momentary rumination fig shows the corresponding survival curve estimated by the product limit method of kaplan and meier for rmdd individuals with low and high instability of affective valence at t in the multiple model residual symptoms at baseline and higher instability of momentary valence remained as independent significant predictors of time to relapse in the model predictors of chronicity higher levels of residual symptoms at baseline more trait rnt and lower levels of momentary energetic arousal were associated with a higher percentage of weeks spent with significant symptoms in the simple regression analyses in the multiple analysis only higher levels of trait rnt remained in the final model predictors of depressive symptom levels simple mixed model analyses revealed that higher levels of depression scores were predicted by more severe residual symptoms higher levels of trait rnt higher momentary rumination and its interaction with time higher instability of momentary rumination as well as by lower levels of momentary positive valence energetic arousal and calmness during daily life in the final multiple model depression scores at baseline and instability of daily life rumination at baseline were retained as independent significant predictors discussion the present longitudinal study investigated both trait and state predictors for the course of depression in a community sample of remitted depressed individuals with regard to risk of relapse chronicity and symptom levels during an observation period of three years we identified a rather unfavorable long term depression course in our sample during the year follow up approximately half of the sample had suffered a relapse into a major depressive episode and nearly had spent more than half of the follow up period with significant depressive symptoms rates of relapses and chronicity are largely comparable to those found in previous research in the present study a shorter time to relapse was predicted by higher residual symptom levels higher instability of momentary mood and higher instability of rumination during daily life at baseline in the multiple model residual symptoms and higher instability of momentary mood remained as significant independent predictors similar to our results previous research has identified residual depressive symptomatology as a serious risk factor for relapse given the high prevalence of residual symptoms during remission even after successful treatment this clearly deserves more attention in future relapse prevention efforts for depression regarding the predictive role of momentary affective state characteristics for the long term course of illness our results showed that a faster time to relapse was predicted by higher instability of momentary mood at baseline thereby confirming our hypothesis in previous studies negative affect variability has been found to predict future negative affective symptoms in rmdd individuals and treatment response in individuals with mdd our longitudinal results confirm and expand these findings by showing that affective instability increases the vulnerability towards relapse this finding has possible clinical implications while current intervention programs aim to reduce the prolonged negative affect in acutely depressed individuals fluctuations in everyday affect appear to be linked to a larger susceptibility for relapses or recurrences and could therefore specifically be considered in relapse prevention programs clearly these considerations warrant more rigorous testing in future research chronicity i e the proportion of weeks spent with significant symptoms was predicted by residual symptom levels high levels of trait repetitive negative thinking and low levels of momentary energetic arousal during daily life at baseline in the multiple model trait repetitive negative thinking was the most powerful and single remaining predictor these results confirm our hypothesis suggesting that dysfunctional cognitive traits represent an important course moderating factor with regard to the development of a chronic course concordantly high levels of habitual state orientation dysfunctional attitudes as well as ruminative thinking have been found to be heightened in chronic depressed individuals or to predict a chronic symptom course finally depressive symptom levels at follow up were predicted by higher levels of residual symptoms and trait rnt as well as by virtually all cognitive and affective state variables residual symptom levels and instability of daily life rumination remained as independent significant predictors in the multiple model with respect to cognitive state variables we found that contrary to our expectation the instability of daily life rumination over the day was an even more important predictor for longer term elevated levels of depressive symptoms than respective mean levels a question is why higher levels of fluctuation in rumination could be maladaptive with this regard possibly the instability of rumination was related to daily life stressors which may have mediated the effect on depression symptom levels however this has not been investigated in the present study and therefore remains speculative our analyses do also not allow to decide whether possible emotional cascades characterized by reciprocal cycles of rumination and negative affect or pure cognitive fluctuations in the context of more stable elevated negative mood at baseline predicted longterm elevated depressed symptoms further research is required on these aspects this study has several limitations first in order to include patients with a primary diagnosis of mdd individuals with certain comorbid diagnoses were excluded which may have led to a somewhat selective sample second we combined samples from two substudies with a somewhat different baseline assessment design to account for a possible influence of subsample status we controlled for this variable and could not identify a possible confounding effect in any of the predictor analyses third although dropout rates were satisfactorily low during the three year period we observed a selective dropout of rmdd individuals with lower education levels thereby reducing the generalizability of our results fourth although all rmdd participants had to be out of episode for at least two months before study inclusion their residual symptom levels varied markedly fifth we did not control for stressful daily life events in the present analyses thus it is difficult to conclude how much individual differences in the assessed affective and cognitive states were affected by environmental influences sixth due to the investigated outcomes the instability measures had to be aggregated thereby eliminating the dynamic aspect at the within subject level however mssd still is a measure of instability demonstrating differences in emotional fluctuations on the between subject level finally the multiple models showed that single predictors were correlated and one could argue that the presentation of results from simple models is dispensable however we think that these results yield information about predictors that could be relevant for research questions in future studies which may particularly apply to the daily life measures in hand to conclude our results imply that illness related characteristics and cognitive vulnerability traits but also affective and cognitive state variables assessed during daily life impact the longer term course of depression while trait repetitive negative thinking particularly predicted longer term chronicity the assessed state variables partly differently affected relapses and levels of depressive symptoms our findings imply that particularly those rmdd individuals showing high fluctuations in daily life affect are susceptible to relapses while individuals with a more frequent unstable pattern of rumination over the day are especially prone to suffer from persistently elevated symptoms importantly these findings were not attributable to higher residual depression levels at baseline since this course relevant clinical predictor was also retained in the respective final multiple models thereby the assessed state variables provided independent contributions for the prediction of outcomes the present findings have several implications first our longitudinal results suggest that mood and rumination instability during daily life indicating specific patterns of emotional dysregulation might reflect a kind of scarring process in patients with former episodes which per se or in combination with other risk factors increases vulnerability towards relapse and maintenance of depressive symptoms in fact both variability parameters were significantly associated with the number of anamnestic mde episodes in that the more depressive episodes an individual had experienced in the past the higher were the current levels of mood and rumination instability this finding is in line with a more dimensional view on scars suggesting a gradual development of vulnerability factors with every mdd episode connected herewith it has been proposed that ambulatory assessment enables to assess basic regulatory processes such as stress reactivity reward dependence and affective instability which may be relevant for a number of mental disorders as regards the latter previous daily life research has investigated affective and cognitive instability features primarily in the context of other disorders such as bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder and non suicidal self injury the present study suggests that instability features may also play a role as course relevant modifiers in major depression thereby lending support for their role as transdiagnostic endophenotypes future longitudinal research testing the role of these aa phenotypes across mental disorders is clearly warranted finally the study of the dynamic interplay of momentary cognitive and affective variables at the micro level may help to even better understand determinants of the course of macro level symptoms and diagnosis supporting information fig fig study design baseline predictors diagnostic information to define outcome variables bdi ii

865,Personality and cognitive vulnerability in remitted recurrently depressed patients,10.1016/j.jad.2014.10.042,1,article7039, introduction a consistent finding among patients with major depressive disorder is the high prevalence of personality disorders prevalence rates of pd comorbidity during mdd typically range between and this wide variability can be explained by the use of different diagnostic instruments the diagnostic system used but also likely depends on the range of pds and mood disorders included few studies examined pd comorbidity prevalence after remission from mdd comorbid pd diagnoses appear to be low to moderately stable and fluctuations over time have been suggested to represent the disorder itself rather than a mood state effect of mdd however it has been demonstrated that personality pathology is generally more stable when measured dimensionally there is ample evidence that having a comorbid pd is a negative prognostic factor for the course of mdd which is reflected by a longer time to remission and increased risk of relapse up to six years however the evidence is less clear for the influence of pds on mdd treatment outcome partly depending on design and analysis strategy mdd with pd comorbidity more than tripled the year risk of mortality and suicide whereas the presence of a borderline pd was related to multiple instead of single suicide attempts over years therefore it is highly relevant to study whether modifiable cognitive vulnerability is associated with comorbid pds and might therefore contribute to a poor prognosis within the cognitive model latent dysfunctional beliefs are a potential cognitive vulnerability factor for relapse all individuals are assumed to develop sets of beliefs about themselves and the world based on experiences and life events once dysfunctional beliefs become activated they can start to dominate one s thinking and responding to situations negative automatic thoughts originate from the belief and in their turn trigger depressive feelings although several studies supported the notion that patients with higher dysfunctional beliefs are at increased risk of relapse the predictive validity of schemas for the first onset of depression and the general role of schema matching life events is less well validated patients with comorbid pds generally endorse heightened levels of dysfunctional beliefs even in the absence of depression which is most pronounced in cluster c besides the content of these beliefs faulty information processing as a result of the activated belief maintains the belief and prevents disconfirming information from becoming incorporated into the cognitive structure therefore it also might be the way patients think that renders them vulnerable for a recurrent course of mdd patients with borderline pd can be characterized by biased thinking including a more negative perception of others thought suppression overgeneralization building on the cognitive model teasdale suggested that dysfunctional beliefs could also be activated by mild dysphoric mood in the remitted phase instead of matching life events to serve as a vulnerability factor for relapse in depression although the activation of dysfunctional beliefs by means of mood induction has been frequently examined it appears that cognitive reactivity can also be assessed using a self report measure that instructs patients to recall how they responded during periods of mild dysphoric mood ilardi and craighead noted that patients with pds are characterized by inner chronic distress potentially serving as a natural primer to activate latent dysfunctional beliefs in line with this reasoning one might expect cognitive reactivity after remission to be more strongly related to pds than dysfunctional beliefs alternatively responding to dysphoric mood with a maladaptive repetitive focus on the causes meaning and consequences of depressive symptoms makes patients vulnerable for early relapse as well especially the brooding component was related to the emergence of depressive symptoms in patients with acute mdd rumination was associated with borderline pd features but not with any specific pd the same was found in student samples without mdd although in these student samples obsessive compulsive pd features were also related to rumination to our knowledge no studies to date examined rumination in patients remitted from mdd with comorbid pds the current study aims to examine potentially modifiable cognitive vulnerability after remission in patients with comorbid personality pathology and to extend findings by ilardi and craighead and craighead et al this is important since we know that patients with pds show dysfunctional thinking even in the absence of depression we are the first to examine a combination of cognitive vulnerability that could potentially mediate the effect of pds on future relapse thereby this study gives impetus to future prospective studies examining depression vulnerability in pd comorbidity moreover current and relapse prevention psychotherapies might reduce cognitive vulnerability factors and thereby reduce risk of relapse nevertheless differential effectiveness of relapse prevention strategies offered after remission for patients with and without pds remains to be examined we expected that the presence of comorbid pds and higher levels of personality pathology would be associated with all measured cognitive vulnerability and rumination and due to the nature of the sample more strongly to cognitive reactivity than to dysfunctional beliefs when studying the classification of specific clusters we expected dysfunctional beliefs to be related to all clusters given the mixed results for the association of specific pd clusters with extreme thinking and the absence of studies on cognitive reactivity and rumination we explored their associations with specific pd clusters finally we examined cognitive vulnerability in the three most prevalent pds in the current sample in an exploratory fashion methods this study combines the baseline data of two randomized controlled trials for readability referred to as study a and study b study a focused on preventive cognitive therapy in groups as an addition or alternative to antidepressant medication versus adm alone in the prevention of relapse in recurrent depression whereas study b studied an internet adaptation of pct added to treatment as usual versus tau alone in the prevention of relapse in recurrent depression medical ethical committee for mental health institutions approved both protocols and all patients provided written informed consent prior to participation participants in both studies patients were included who had a experienced at least two lifetime major depressive episodes of which the last mde was no longer than two years ago b current remission of the last mde for at least two months both defined according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders and assessed with the structured clinical interview for dsm iv disorders administered by trained interviewers and c a current score of r on the item hamilton depression rating scale exclusion criteria were current mania hypomania a history of bipolar illness any psychotic disorder organic brain damage current alcohol or drug abuse predominant anxiety disorder and recent electroconvulsive therapy both studies included remitted patients but differed to the extent that study a only included patients who a were currently on adm for at least six months and b did not receive psychotherapy more frequent than twice per month in study b there were no restrictions with respect to both type and frequency of current care measures following inclusion and prior to receiving pct patients completed amongst others the following questionnaires online dysfunctional attitude scale version a in the current study the dutch adaptation of the das a was used to assess rigid dysfunctional beliefs an exemplary item is people will probably think less of me if i make a mistake on the das a patients rated their agreement with each item on a seven point scale that ranged from totally agree to totally disagree the total number of extreme responses on the das was used as a measure of extreme response style on the das similar to beevers et al and jacobs et al lessor change in extreme responding over treatment predicted earlier return of depressive symptoms the das a demonstrated excellent reliability in a previous study and had a reliability of in the current study leiden index of depression sensitivity the leids is a self report questionnaire that aims to measure cognitive reactivity to sad mood independent of mood induction after imagining a mildly depressed mood patients rated all items on a scale that ranged from one not applicable to five strongly applicable an exemplary item is when i feel sad i feel i can afford less mistakes the leids was found to be significantly associated with changes in dysfunctional beliefs following mood induction cronbach s alpha in the current study was ruminative response scale rumination was assessed using the validated dutch adaptation of the rrs the rrs nl an exemplary item is i think about how lonely i feel patients rated their agreement on a scale that ranged from almost always to almost never the five item subscale brooding was used as this aspect of rumination appears to specifically reflect dysfunctional and maladaptive thinking and is strongly related to depression later in time in the current study cronbach s alpha for the total rrs was and for the brooding subscale personality diagnostic questionnaire the pdq is a self report personality questionnaire with true false items that directly correspond to personality disorders in the dsm iv moreover the total pdq score reflects overall continuous personality pathology the internal consistency of the pdq ranged between and in a previous study for internal consistencies in the current study see table lower internal consistencies of the pdq have been attributed to the nature of pds itself a known limitation of the pdq is its risk of false positives to further improve diagnostic accuracy the threshold for diagnosing a personality disorder was increased by raising the number of criteria required for each disorder by one which increased diagnostic power and higher agreement between the pdq and the scid ii in a previous study inventory of depressive symptomatology self report the dutch translation of the item ids sr was used to assess levels of depressive symptomatology the ids sr is a self report measure on which patients rate their symptoms on a scale from zero to three the ids sr rates all dsm iv core symptom domains including mood cognitive and psychomotor symptoms but also commonly associated symptoms including anxiety the ids sr had excellent internal consistency in a previous study cronbach s alpha in the current study was data analysis in order to combine the baseline data from both studies we first assessed potential differences between patient groups groups were compared on gender age age of onset number of previous mdes last mde severity percentage of adm use as well as clinical measures including ham d das leids rrs pdq and ids sr subsequently using spss version multiple imputation by chained equations was used to account for the of the data that were missing the imputations were combined according to rubin s rules multiple imputation is a state of the art technique and preferred above other missing data approaches including case wise deletion as suggested the threshold for pdq personality disorder diagnosis was increased by one criterion for each disorder we then used univariate regression analysis to examine the association of personality on the following dependent measures dysfunctional beliefs cognitive reactivity and rumination we also examined whether personality pathology was related to an extreme response style on the das a because the number of extreme responses showed strong deviations from a normal distribution we used the non parametric mann whitney u test instead moreover we studied whether the presence versus absence of personality clusters was specifically related to any of the dependent measures finally we analyzed cognitive vulnerability in the three most prevalent pds in all models we checked whether residual depressive symptomatology changed the effect of personality pathology on the dependent variable by adding the ids sr as a covariate in the analysis results preliminary analyses in order to analyze the data of the two trials together we first assessed differences between the two studies patients did not differ between trials with respect to gender age age of onset number of previous mdes ham d at inclusion whether or not they received current psychotherapy personality disorders dysfunctional beliefs cognitive reactivity brooding and residual symptoms therefore the baseline data of both trials was merged however as expected current use of adm was higher in study a than in study b po moreover last depressive episode severity was somewhat higher in study a than in study b controlling for adm use and last episode severity did not change any of the results patients in total patients were included in both trials patients were predominantly female and were currently in remission as defined by the ham d with a median of previous mdes table presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of the complete sample personality disorder prevalence we found an indication that of the patients in our sample had a comorbid personality disorder among all patients had one pd had two pds and had three or more pds most patients had a diagnosis in cluster c followed by cluster a and cluster b avoidant pd was the most prevalent disorder followed by obsessive compulsive pd and then paranoid pd see table for an overview of pd prevalence in the current sample vulnerability for continuous and categorical personality pathology as depicted in table both pd diagnosis and continuous pathology were significantly related to dysfunctional beliefs cognitive reactivity and brooding continuous pd pathology accounted for of variation in dysfunctional beliefs the results did not change significantly when we controlled for residual depressive symptoms patients with a comorbid pd did not differ significantly from patients without comorbid pd on their level of extreme responses on the das a vulnerability by personality cluster as depicted in table dysfunctional beliefs were significantly associated with the presence of a cluster a cluster b and cluster c diagnosis the same was true for cognitive reactivity most of the variance in both dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive reactivity was accounted for by having a cluster c diagnosis although more variance was explained in dysfunctional beliefs than in cognitive reactivity only having a cluster c diagnosis was significantly related to brooding scores however after controlling for residual symptoms the presence of a cluster a diagnosis was no longer related to cognitive reactivity no other effects of controlling for residual symptoms were found finally non parametric tests revealed that there were no differences in extremity of thinking on the das a between the presence versus absence of a pd diagnosis in cluster a cluster b and or cluster c vulnerability in the three most prevalent personality disorders finally we assessed cognitive vulnerability in the three most prevalent pds in the current sample together these three disorders comprised of the total number of pds diagnosed being diagnosed with an avoidant pd was significantly associated with dysfunctional beliefs po adj r reactivity of these beliefs po adj r as well as brooding po adj r similarly paranoid pd was associated with dysfunctional beliefs po adj r and reactivity of these beliefs p adj r although brooding was unrelated to having a cluster a diagnosis in general having a paranoid pd was associated with brooding levels p adj r remarkably having an obsessive compulsive pd was unrelated to brooding p having an obsessive compulsive pd was associated with higher levels of dysfunctional beliefs po adj r and cognitive reactivity p adj r after correction for residual symptoms with the ids sr having a paranoid pd was no longer related to brooding p and cognitive reactivity p no other effects of controlling for residual symptoms were found discussion the central aim of the current study was to examine potentially modifiable cognitive vulnerability factors in patients remitted from mdd with and without a comorbid pd in order to unravel why these patients might be prone to a chronic and persistent course of mdd this study gives impetus to which cognitive vulnerability to examine as potential mediators of the effect of pds on future relapse specifically addressing cognitive vulnerability factors might thereby reduce risk of relapse our findings indicate that pds remain highly prevalent after remission from recurrent mdd this closely resembles findings by previous studies that reported a and pd prevalence after remission as well as a study during the acute phase of mdd that asked patients to recall their typical self in line with farabaugh et al avoidant pd obsessive compulsive pd and paranoid pd were the most prevalent pds in our remitted population we found that rumination was associated with both the presence of a pd and higher levels of pd pathology a closer inspection revealed that rumination was associated with avoidant pd and not with obsessive compulsive pd as was also found in a student sample rumination might serve as a way of avoiding both cognitive and active problem solving since it was found that rumination and avoidance are associated as rumination has also been linked to borderline pd dimensions in several previous studies we examined post hoc whether this was also applicable to borderline pd in our patient group similar to paranoid pd we found that borderline pd was related to rumination however not over and above residual depressive symptomatology this suggests that in these patients rumination might be a reflection of depressive symptomatology instead of the pd itself since we assessed cluster classification in an exploratory fashion future studies should attempt to replicate these findings moreover since effective relapse prevention interventions are available it is worthwhile to examine whether these interventions target rumination specifically as far as we know this was the first study that examined cognitive reactivity in remitted patients with and without a pd according to beck s cognitive model applied to personality disorders and suggested by previous studies we expected dysfunctional beliefs to be more easily activated in patients with pd comorbidity we indeed found that cognitive reactivity was associated with both having a pd or higher levels of pd pathology which suggests that pd pathology might serve as an innate primer or stressor for dysfunctional beliefs cognitive reactivity was associated with classification in all three pd clusters although the association with cluster a disappeared after controlling for residual depressive symptoms similar to our cognitive reactivity findings and replicating previous studies we also found that dysfunctional beliefs appear to represent an overarching cognitive vulnerability for all pd clusters however remarkable for a remitted population dysfunctional beliefs showed a stronger association with pd levels than cognitive reactivity even after controlling for residual symptomatology in our analyses the association with dysfunctional beliefs remained the strongest this could imply that due to the innate stress caused by the pd the das itself is also a measure of cognitive reactivity in this group given the moderate association between the leids and depressive symptomatology comparable to the das the leids appears to be affected by state effects of depression as well finally we found that a dichotomous thinking style was not specifically related to pds or levels of pd pathology in our remitted patient group findings on the role of dichotomous thinking in pds and borderline pd specifically have been mixed a recent study demonstrated that instead of dichotomous thinking negativistic thinking was typical for borderline pd the cognitive model is not explicit about how and when early critical life events lead to an accumulation and consolidation of dysfunctional beliefs into mdd pd or their combination it still has to be determined whether dysfunctional beliefs accumulate over time and consolidate into a pd or whether they are a byproduct of the pd itself the lack of differentiation in the associations of dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive reactivity with the pd clusters strongly suggests that this cognitive vulnerability might be an epiphenomenon of the pd despite similar patterns the low to moderate association between dysfunctional beliefs and their reactivity does suggest that these questionnaires measure different constructs strengths of the current study include use of a large recurrently depressed patient sample relatively unaffected by state effects due to remission of the mde the use of several well validated measures and the examination of a combination of cognitive vulnerability including rumination on the level of both pd clusters and disorders several limitations should also be taken into account first we used a self report instrument to diagnose pds instead of the semistructured interview for personality disorders although we adjusted the pdq with one criterion to reduce over diagnosis and moreover the prevalence of pds in the current sample was comparable to other studies using remitted mdd samples we cannot completely rule out that the pdq overestimated the prevalence of pds second some of the pds had a low prevalence potentially related to our inclusion criteriamania and alcohol and drug abuse hence we were not able to examine these pds specifically third the current study used a cross sectional approach to study vulnerability in patients with a comorbid pd therefore we were unable to determine whether these cognitive vulnerabilities indeed predict a poor mdd prognosis in these patients prospectively fourth we cannot rule out that the concepts of pds and cognitive vulnerability have the same underlying construct which would explain their association overlapping items within the pdq and the das could therefore also explain their association future studies should be attentive of this potential overlap finally the inclusion criteria of our studies might affect the generalizability of the results future studies should attempt to replicate our findings on cognitive vulnerability and specific pds since dysfunctional beliefs were more strongly associated with pds after remission than cognitive reactivity the question arises whether the assessment of mood linked activation of dysfunctional beliefs is relevant in this specific group future studies should also examine whether rumination and other modifiable cognitive vulnerability mediate the effects that pds have on time to relapse in order to be able to better understand the mechanisms that drive relapse prevention strategies subsequently tailoring preventive interventions might improve their efficacy however it remains to be examined whether relapse prevention strategies offered after remission have different effects on patients with and without comorbid

775,Negative Self-Referential Processing Predicts the Recurrence of Major Depressive Episodes,10.1177/2167702616654898,1,article9491, history of mdd will experience another episode of depression within a few years of recovery from the original episode moreover recurrence rates are as high as for individuals who have already experienced two depressive episodes given these alarming statistics and the enormous costs of mdd it is critical that we identify predictors of recurrence in individuals with a history of mdd and ultimately intervene to alter the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in the current study we aimed to examine whether negatively biased self referential processing increases the risk for recurrence after accounting for demographic and clinical variables that are known to influence recurrence including baseline depressive symptoms psychotropic medication use and stressful life events cognitive theories of depression emphasize that negative biases in the cognitive processing of emotional information play a critical role in the onset maintenance and recurrence of depressive episodes for example beck posited that negative cognitive schemas are a salient risk factor for depression they are conceptualized as negatively biased representations of self referential cognition that influence the way in which individuals attend to interpret and recall emotional information moreover in his differential activation hypothesis teasdale proposed that patterns of information processing become established during initial depressive episodes and then influence cognition when individuals experience a dysphoric mood state specifically dysphoric mood negatively biases information processing thereby increasing negative interpretations of events making negative self referential constructs more accessible and ultimately increasing the likelihood of recurrence historically research examining cognitive predictors of recurrence has relied exclusively on self report measures of cognition however there are drawbacks to this approach self report measures are limited by individual differences in participants level of insight and selfawareness they are also subject to recall demand and reference biases moreover because of the use of likert scales self report measures are subject to response bias and diminished sensitivity it is for these and other reasons that information processing tasks have increasingly been used to elucidate the nature of cognitive biases in other domains of depression research indeed information processing tasks have been central in advancing our understanding of individuals who are currently depressed there is now a wealth of evidence from studies of performance on information processing tasks demonstrating that currently depressed individuals are characterized by negative biases in attention memory and interpretation moreover researchers using information processing tasks have found that formerly depressed individuals also show biases in attention and memory in fact there is growing evidence that compared to participants without a history of depression formerly depressed participants exhibit negatively biased selfreferential processing when they are in a negative mood state biased self referential processing reflects participants underlying negative cognitive schemas and thus might be an important marker of vulnerability to depression to date however investigators have used exclusively self report measures to examine cognitive predictors of episode recurrence in depression thus we do not know whether performance on a self referential processing task can predict the onset of future depressive episodes this study is the first to examine whether performance on an information processing task predicts the onset of a subsequent depressive episode we recruited women who were currently not depressed but who had experienced two or more depressive episodes both to increase the homogeneity of our sample and because this population is at high risk for recurrence at baseline we assessed selfreferential processing using the self referential encoding task importantly following recovery from a depressive episode cognitive biases can remain latent until they are activated by a negative mood induction therefore before participants completed the sret we induced a negative mood state moreover given the evidence demonstrating that risk for recurrence is influenced by baseline depressive symptoms psychotropic medication use and stressful life events we included these variables as predictors in our model of depression recurrence in order to assess the unique contribution of self referential processing after accounting for these variables because baseline depressive symptoms have been found to influence the experience of subsequent negative life events we hypothesized that more severe depressive symptoms at baseline would predict a higher number of negative life events which in turn would predict future episodes of depression we also hypothesized that more negatively biased self referential processing would predict recurrence above and beyond associations with other variables included in the model method participants participants were women diagnosed with major depressive disorder recurrent in full remission defined as having at least two past depressive episodes but not having experienced a major depressive episode for the past two months women were recruited from the community and screened for initial inclusion exclusion criteria via a telephone interview potentially eligible participants came to the laboratory for an in person diagnostic interview to assess current and past psychopathology interviews were conducted by post baccalaureate research assistants who received extensive training on dsm iv tr diagnostic criteria and on administration of the scid i inter rater reliability was excellent individuals were excluded if they had experienced severe head trauma were not fluent in english had learning disabilities bipolar disorder or psychotic symptoms or met diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders criteria for alcohol or substance abuse within the past six months baseline assessment mood induction we induced a negative mood state by having participants watch one of three randomly assigned six minute film clips while viewing the film clip and for an additional two minutes following the clip participants imagined being in the situation and the feelings they would experience in the situation participants rated their mood before and after the mood induction on a point likert scale ranging from very sad to very happy self referential encoding task the sret consisted of adjectives positive and negative to construct the sret we compiled a larger list of adjectives from previous studies of information processing in depression five psychology graduate students then rated each word in the list as having a positive or a negative valence adjectives were retained only if agreement was unanimous the final positive and negative word lists did not differ in word length familiarity or level of arousal the sret was presented using e prime software version participants were seated in front of a computer and were instructed to place their right index finger on a key labeled yes and their left index finger on a key labeled no each trial began with the phrase describes me presented in the middle of the screen for ms after ms participants were presented with one of the adjectives in random order and were instructed to indicate whether the word described them by pressing the corresponding key participants responses were recorded on each trial lastly a ms fixation cross was presented participants completed several practice trials followed by the experimental trials during which the experimenter was outside of the room participants then worked for minutes on a distractor task the digit symbol task of the wais r the experimenter then returned to administer an incidental recall task participants were given a sheet of paper and were asked to recall as many words as possible from the sret regardless of whether they had endorsed the words as selfdescriptive there was no time limit we calculated four dependent variables from the sret task number of positive and of negative words endorsed as self referential and number of positive and of negative words recalled to be consistent with recent research and to control for individual differences in rates of overall endorsement and recall we computed recall of endorsed positive and negative words as proportions of the total number of words endorsed and recalled because these proportions sum to and analyses of positive and negative words produce identical coefficients with the opposite sign we present recall results only for negative words although some researchers have also examined participants reaction time to assess the self relevance of each word we did not use this approach in the current study because our version of the sret did not instruct participants regarding response time consequently numerous factors could confound interpretation of reaction time data therefore consistent with recent research we analyzed the number of positive and of negative words endorsed as self referential self report measures participants completed the beck depression inventory ii a item measure of depressive symptoms they also completed the shipley institute of living scale a vocabulary test that provides a reliable estimate of verbal intelligence and that is frequently used to ensure the observed group differences on cognitive tasks are not due to differences in verbal ability follow up assessments subsequent mde we followed participants for three years after their time visit or until they experienced a recurrent depressive episode during this time participants were asked to return to the laboratory approximately every months to complete the scid i and self report questionnaires of the original participants were lost to attrition and returned to the laboratory but did not complete the scid i during the follow up assessment typically due to time constraints the current study was part of a larger longitudinal investigation examining girls at risk for depression based on their mothers history of the disorder therefore when time was constrained assessments related to the daughters were prioritized for the remaining participants interviewers used the scid i to assess whether participants experienced an mde since their last assessment if a participant did not attend her month follow up visit we assessed the presence of a depressive episode since her initial time visit at the year visit of the participants experienced an mde within three years of their baseline assessment missing data resulting from participant attrition were unrelated to participants age ethnicity marital status household income education baseline depressive symptoms psychotropic medication use shipley test scores or sret performance ps negative life events following the scid participants reported on the life events that they had experienced since the previous assessment using the life events survey participants reported on the presence of a total of life events a total negative life events score was computed by calculating the average number of negative life events that were endorsed per month since the last assessment thus a negative life events score of would indicate that a participant had experienced on average one negative life event per month since her last assessment negative life event scores were examined for the period immediately prior to the recurrent depressive episode for those participants who experienced a recurrence or for the matched follow up assessment period for those participants who did not experience a recurrence for example if a participant experienced a recurrence of depression at the first follow up assessment we examined negative life event scores reported at the first follow up assessment both for that participant and for the matched participant who did not experience a recurrence of depression procedure within one week of their diagnostic evaluation eligible participants were scheduled for their baseline assessment where they completed a measure of mood and a negative mood induction they then completed a second mood measure followed by the sret to assess the occurrence of another depressive episode within three years of the baseline assessment participants returned to the laboratory approximately every months for three years or until they experienced a recurrent depressive episode during these follow up assessments participants were administered the scid and reported on negative life events experienced since their last assessment planned analyses in order to test simultaneous predictors of recurrence while also accounting for hypothesized interrelations among the predictors we used mplus version statistical software to conduct structural equation modeling analyses sem has advantages over other analytic approaches including the ability to handle missing data without the need for listwise deletion or imputation our model consisted of two parts a measurement model that consisted of factor loadings for the observed sret variables that indexed the latent factor of selfreferential processing and a structural model that consisted of path and correlation coefficients that connected the latent and observed variables in a model predicting recurrence of a depressive episode within three years our structural model was developed based on a priori expectations of predictors of depression recurrence which was treated as a categorical variable we used weighted least squares mean variance as is recommended for categorical variables results participant characteristics demographic and clinical characteristics of participants are presented in table participants who experienced a recurrence of depression and those who did not did not differ significantly in age t ethnicity marital status household income education shipley test scores t number of previous depressive episodes t p baseline bdi scores t or proportion taking psychotropic medication all ps ns we also examined group differences in sret performance at baseline compared to participants in the nrec group participants in the rec group endorsed significantly fewer positive words t p and recalled a higher proportion of negative words that were endorsed t p the two groups did not differ in the number of negative words endorsed t p participants sret performance was not related to their number of previous depressive episodes rs ps mood induction to examine the effectiveness of the mood induction we conducted a group by time repeated measures analysis of variance on selfreported mood as expected this analysis yielded a significant main effect of time f p ci participants mood significantly declined from before to after watching the video clip neither the main effect of group nor the interaction of group and time was significant fs ps s thus mood at the time of the sret would not explain observed group effects predicting depression recurrence model fit results indicated that the a priori model was a strong fit to the data comparative fit index tucker lewis index and root mean square error of approximation no modification indices greater than were suggested parameter estimates as can be seen in figure all three of the sret variables loaded significantly on the sret latent variable as expected number of positive words endorsed loaded negatively on the sret latent variable p ci and both number of negative words endorsed p ci and proportion of negative words recalled p ci loaded positively on the sret latent variable thus higher scores on the sret latent variable represent more negatively biased self referential processing recurrence of major depression within three years within the larger structural model the baseline variables were allowed to correlate not surprisingly higher baseline bdi scores were correlated with more negative biases on the sret r p ci no other correlations were significant neither bdi scores nor psychotropic medication use directly contributed to recurrence i si ps as hypothesized however higher baseline bdi scores predicted higher subsequent negative life event scores p ci in turn higher negative life event scores tended to predict recurrence p ci the indirect path between baseline bdi scores and recurrence was not significant p ci importantly after accounting for the concurrent and predictive relations among all other variables included in the model the sret latent variable contributed unique and significant variance to the likelihood of recurrence p ci which is considered a large effect specifically more negative self referential processing at baseline significantly increased the likelihood that formerly depressed individuals would experience a recurrent mde over the next three years discussion this study is the first to examine whether performance on an information processing task predicts the onset of a subsequent depressive episode in adults with a history of mdd consistent with previously reported rates of recurrence of the women in the current study experienced a recurrent depressive episode within three years of their baseline assessment path analyses indicated that higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted higher subsequent negative life event scores which in turn tended to predict recurrence importantly after accounting for concurrent and prospective associations among other variables included in the model negatively biased self referential processing contributed unique variance to the likelihood of experiencing a recurrent depressive episode within the next three years specifically compared to participants who did not subsequently experience a recurrent episode of depression participants who experienced a recurrent episode endorsed at baseline fewer positive words and more negative words and recalled more negative words that they endorsed compared to remitted depressed individuals in other investigations participants in the current study who experienced a subsequent depressive episode endorsed and recalled slightly fewer positive and more negative words whereas participants who did not experience a subsequent depressive episode endorsed and recalled slightly more positive and fewer negative words both groups however endorsed and recalled fewer positive and more negative self referential adjectives than did healthy controls in other studies these data represent the first support using an experimental task for the long held assertion that negatively biased self referential processing is a risk factor for recurrent depressive episodes our findings are consistent with recent studies conducted in community samples of children and adolescents showing that negative biases in selfreferential processing predict subsequent increases in depressive symptoms and they extend this research to the prediction of a diagnosable recurrent depressive episodes in adult women previous research on predictors of depression recurrence has focused on demographic clinical or environmental variables which are difficult if not impossible to alter in contrast cognitive predictors of recurrence can be directly targeted and altered our findings support cognitive interventions that modify negative self schemas and biases in selfreferential processing in particular there are several cognitive bias modification paradigms that could be effective in altering negative biases in self referential processing for example lang blackwell harmer davison and holmes used a cbm task designed to change negative thinking styles through the use of mental imagery this approach might be readily adapted to target more specifically negative self referential thinking alternatively a version of the implicit association test could be used in which words that are related to the self are disproportionately paired with positive self referential adjectives regardless of the specific intervention the current findings indicate that such treatment may be effective in reducing rates of recurrence of depression in women with a history of mdd it is important to note three limitations of the current study first we used a self report measure of stressful life events which is subject to subjective reporting biases and is likely to be less sensitive in capturing the clinical impact of stressful life events than are interviewbased assessments second we included only females which limits the generalizability of our findings although this increased the homogeneity of our sample and minimized the influence of confounding variables that disproportionately affect women it will be important in future research to include males to examine possible gender differences in cognitive risk factors for recurrence finally despite our best effort to retain participants of the original were lost to attrition and returned to the laboratory but did not complete the scid i during their follow up assessment typically due to time constraints future research should consider alternative methods to increase participant retention future research might also examine whether negatively biased self referential processing increases risk for the first onset of a depressive episode despite these limitations this study advances our understanding of cognitive risk factors for depression recurrence by using an information processing task to test for the first time the hypothesis that negatively biased self referential processing predicts a recurrent depressive episode above and beyond depressive symptoms at baseline psychotropic medication and negative life events identifying negative biases in self referential processing as a risk factor for recurrence has important implications for intervention efforts by altering the negative self schemas that underlie biases in self referential processing we may be able to reduce the high rates of episode recurrence in mdd we are hopeful that the current study will also advance our understanding of cognitive risk factors that predict the recurrence of depression by encouraging a larger methodological shift in research toward using informationprocessing tasks to assess cognitive

65,Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care,10.1016/j.jad.2017.08.009,1,article8285, introduction depression is a chronic disorder characterized by relapses substantial residual symptomatology the unfavorable long term course of depression suggests a stable underlying vulnerability driving the waxing and waning of depression related symptoms attachment is a moderately stable personality characteristic that has been assumed to have an enduring influence on people s functioning insecure attachment may contribute to the development of psychopathology by its corollaries with dysfunctional emotion regulation and support seeking impact of attachment on the long term course of depression has however rarely been studied therefore we examined whether attachment predicted depression outcomes over a seven year period attachment according to attachment theory interactional experiences with caregivers and subsequently with partners and low avoidance of intimacy both strengthen functional emotion regulation and support seeking which makes secure attachment an inner source of resilience when proximity seeking is intermittently reinforced by the attachment figure preoccupied attachment may develop this style is characterized by high anxiety about rejection by significant others to deal with this attachment anxiety the preoccupied attached person hyperactivates emotions in order to gain attention from others and to coerce them into providing support this hyperactivation strategy may itself culminate in psychopathology and the coercive way of mobilizing support may discourage others from offering help when proximity seeking remains consistently non reinforced by attachment figures dismissing avoidant attachment may develop this style is characterized by high avoidance of intimacy the distrust is dealt with by deactivation of the attachment system which is associated with avoidance of support seeking and the suppression of emotions this strategy may leave distress unresolved and may accordingly contribute to the development of psychopathology especially with prolonged distress that urges for support of others this is problematic alternation of both hyper and deactivation is characteristic of fearful avoidant attachment fearful avoidant individuals are high on anxiety about rejection as well as high on avoidance of intimacy resulting in an approach avoidance conflict this means they have difficulties in functioning autonomously but also in generating support from others therefore fearful avoidant attachment is associated with the most severe psychopathology attachment and depression a review of cross sectional studies consistently showed that insecure attachment in particular attachment anxiety was associated with higher severity of depression than secure attachment a minority of the reviewed studies prospectively assessed associations between attachment and depression unfortunately follow up periods were generally quite short ranging from several weeks to months moreover only three studies focused on depressed patients but the length of the prospective follow up periods was limited to one year in sum there is an empirical gap with respect to the presumed impact of insecure attachment on the long term course of depression we therefore examined a sample of primary care patients with a diagnosis of depression and tested whether attachment predicted the seven year course of multiple depression related outcomes based on the literature we hypothesized that insecure attachment i e preoccupied dismissing avoidant and in particular fearful avoidant attachment would show less favorable long term depression outcomes than secure attachment methods patients and procedure the sample of the current long term study was part of the sample of our mentioned study on associations between attachment and the short term course of depression the sample participated in a randomized controlled trial which aimed at the enhancement of treatment of depression in primary care included were primary care patients meeting criteria for a current or recent major depressive episode treated by the general practitioner patients were randomized to one of four treatments care as usual by the gp the low intensity psycho education prevention program one psychiatric consultation session followed by pep or sessions cognitive behavioral therapy followed by pep patients were followed up for three years the present study reports data on the subsequent seven year follow conradi et al at the start of the seven year follow up the ecr comprises items and measures the two fundamental attachment dimensions anxiety about rejection and abandonment i e expectancies of being perceived by partners as unacceptable or unlovable taps into hyperactivation strategies a sample item is i worry about being abandoned avoidance of intimacy i e expectancies of inaccessibility and unresponsiveness of partners to one s attachment needs taps into deactivation strategies one sample item is i try to avoid getting too close to my partner items are rated on a point likert response scale ranging from to with a middle position we also analyzed attachment styles i e secure preoccupied dismissing avoidant and fearful avoidant for two reasons first in clinical practice use of styles prevails over dimensions and we aimed for clinical utility second we aimed to maximize comparability of the current long term results with our earlier reported short term follow up by using the categorization of patients made in the study this categorization was based on a two step cluster analyses described by brennan et al using the avoidance and anxiety scores clustering in a general population sample resulted in fisher linear discriminant functions that yielded populationbased norms with which we categorized patients from the current sample into one of four styles i e secure preoccupied dismissing avoidant and fearful avoidant favorable psychometric properties in multiple samples have been observed in support of validity and reliability of the dutch ecr all patients reported having had one or more present or past romantic relationship s and were therefore deemed able to meaningfully complete the questionnaire to obtain more insight in the extent of the problems of the attachment groups we concurrently administered several additional questionnaires loneliness was measured with the items of the loneliness scale cronbach s was in the current study relational dysfunctioning was assessed with the marital functioning subscale of the maudsley marital questionnaire consisting of items finally locus of control was measured with the mastery scale consisting of items outcome instruments the same outcome measures were elected as in our previous shortterm course study as the current study was developed as its long term follow up outcomes regarding the seven year follow up were retrospectively assessed seven years after administration of the ecr by means of two face to face interviews at the patient s home first the depression section of the lifetime composite international diagnostic interview a widely used structured interview for the assessment of mdes with strong psychometric support was administered additional questions were added that assessed month and year of onset as well as remission of the cidi identified mdes second the longitudinal interval follow up evaluation a lifechart based interview was administered in a version comparable to the one used by yiend and colleagues with the life month by month severity of depression was assessed good to excellent iccs were found with the life moreover research has shown that validity of retrospective long term recall is enhanced when supported by adequate anchoring of major events in the current study patients were provided with three types of anchor points first approximately one hour was spent by interviewers and patients to identify personal and historical events that were used as aids to retrieve severity of depressive complaints anchoring events used were relationships education and work moves birth diseases and death finance birthdays and anniversaries holidays and journeys other life events and historical events second onset and remission of the cidi identified mdes were added as anchor points to the life chart third scores on the beck depression inventory seven years earlier and the bdi score at the moment the life interview was administered were used as two additional anchor points to support memory to this end both bdi scores were converted to the point response scale that was used in the life interview to estimate the severity of depressive complaints namely not at all little pretty much much and very much the monthly life severity scores were averaged into three monthly scores to improve reliability the percentage of missing life chart data was the cidi and the life were administered by experienced research assistants who were trained extensively and supervised each months by the project leader outcome measures relapse recurrence rate i e the percentage of patients who experienced according to dsm iv criteria one or more mde s during the seven year follow up number of mdes during the seven year follow up period proportion depression diagnosis free time defined as the time that patients did not meet dsm iv criteria for mde during the seven year follow up proportion symptom free time defined as the time during the sevenyear follow up that patients did not suffer from depressive symptoms course of severity of depression on a three monthly basis during the seven year follow up at the end of follow up severity of depression was also measured with the bdi consisting of items finally duration of antidepressant medication usage was assessed for the seven year follow up with the same questions as used during instel power analyses for pairwise comparisons we calculated the post hoc power for the pairwise comparisons between the attachment groups for the seven year course of severity of depression as measured with the life with g power g power requires the total sample size of the two comparison groups and as the attachment group sizes were of unequal size we calculated the harmonic mean of the two pairwise compared groups and multiplied this by to compute the total sample size based on a repeated measurement anova with measurements with an inter correlation of g power showed that the power to detect an effect size of cohen s d in the comparison between the secure and preoccupied dismissing avoidant groups was and respectively the power to detect an effect size of cohen s d between the secure and the fearful avoidant attachment groups was this means that the secure vs preoccupied dismissing avoidant comparisons were slightly underpowered comparisons regarding the outcomes based on the categorical variables and categorical outcomes were supposedly not adequately powered statistical analyses we first tested whether attachment style was confounded with treatment condition we therefore examined if the attachment categories were randomly distributed over the treatment groups next we compared the four attachment categories on socio demographic and clinical variables at the start of the seven year follow up chi square tests were applied to categorical measures and one way anovas to the continuous measures outcomes were described by computing percentages for categorical variables medians and iqrs for continuous variables that were not normally distributed and estimated marginal means and ses for severity of depression associations between attachment antidepressant use and depression outcomes during the seven year followup were analyzed in two ways first we computed bivariate spearman s rho correlations between both attachment dimensions avoidance and anxiety and antidepressants use and depression outcomes second we used chi square tests to compare the four attachment styles in case of categorical outcomes and mann whitney non parametric tests in case of continuous not normally distributed outcomes to test for differences between attachment groups during follow up on severity of depression we applied linear mixed models on the repeated measurements this analysis makes optimal use of the available data taking into account the clustering of assessments within subjects attachment group was applied as fixed factor ar as covariance structure and a random intercept was added to the model guided by our hypotheses we were interested in the post hoc pairwise comparisons between the secure group on the one hand and the insecure groups on the other significance levels were set at p for all analyses finally effect sizes were computed using estimated marginal means and sds of the raw scores results patient characteristics at the start of the seven year follow up first we tested for baseline equivalence in terms of the distribution of attachment categories over treatment conditions the distribution of the four attachment styles over the four treatment groups did not systematically differ from chance socio demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline are displayed in table the patients were on average years old and were female fearful avoidantly attached reported significantly less often being involved a relationship than the other groups almost all patients met dsm iv criteria for lifetime recurrent major depression the fearful avoidant group reported significantly higher on loneliness than the other attachment groups and together with the dismissing avoidant and preoccupied groups more marital dysfunction and less mastery than the securely attached depression outcomes during seven year follow up the attachment dimensions showed significant and highly similar correlations with multiple depression outcomes both attachment avoidance and anxiety were significant and negatively related to proportion of symptom free time and positively to mean severity during the seven year follow up and the single measurement seven years after the attachment assessment no significant associations were found with number of mdes developed during the seven year follow up nor with the proportion of time patients were depression diagnosis free or the duration of antidepressants usage relapse recurrence rate in general was with the fearful avoidant group showing a significantly higher rate than the secure group median number of relapses recurrences for all patients was and did not significantly differ between styles median proportion of depression diagnosis free time was with the fearful avoidant group reporting a significantly smaller proportion than the secure group median proportion of symptom free time was with the fearful avoidant preoccupied and dismissing avoidant groups reporting significantly lower symptom free time than the secure group mean severity of depression during the seven year follow up was on the point scale used with the fearful avoidant and dismissing avoidant groups reporting significantly higher severity than the secure group did corresponding with effect sizes of d and d respectively when adjusted for mean severity in the month preceding the attachment assessment the difference between the fearful avoidant and secure groups remained significant equivalent to an effect size of d severity of depression measured by the single bdi measurement seven years after the attachment assessment supported findings obtained by the life overall a mean of was found with the fearfulavoidant and dismissing avoidant groups showing significantly higher bdi total scores than the secure group equivalent to effect sizes of d and d respectively after adjustment for mean severity in the month preceding the attachment assessment the difference between the secure and fearfulavoidant groups remained significant with a large effect size finally almost of all patients used antidepressants during the seven year follow up which did not significantly diverge across attachment groups discussion the present study is one of few prospective studies to examine the predictive potency of both attachment dimensions and styles in patients suffering from recurrent depression and to our knowledge the only study with a seven year follow up findings largely confirmed our expectation that attachment would predict the long term course of tests of the estimated mean differences of severity of depression are based on post hoc pairwise comparisons from the linear mixed model tests of the mean differences of severity of depression are based on post hoc pairwise comparisons depression more specifically the attachment dimensions avoidance and anxiety showed significant and comparable associations with unfavorable depression outcomes compared to the secure attachment style the preoccupied and dismissing avoidant styles showed an unfavorable depression course and as expected the fearful avoidant group had the worst long term course of depression depression outcomes the findings of the present study provide empirical support for the assumption of the long term impact of attachment and confirm our earlier short term findings the influence of insecure attachment was even seven years after its assessment still detectable contrary to the overview offered by mikulincer and shaver the impact of the attachment dimension anxiety was not greater than that of avoidance but of similar magnitude a possible explanation is that almost all patients in our sample were recurrently depressed i e supposedly more severely affected by the disorder than respondents in many of the previously reviewed studies avoidant attachment has been related to suppression of emotions which leaves distress unresolved and accordingly may be especially troublesome in the long term comparison with the secure attachment style revealed that the preoccupied group reported a lower proportion of symptom free time while the dismissing avoidant group reported a lower proportion of symptom free time and higher severity of depression however as predicted comparison of the fearful avoidant group with the secure group revealed an even more marked pattern of worse depression outcomes i e a higher relapse recurrence rate lower proportions of depression diagnosis free time and symptom free time and a higher mean severity of depression these findings suggest that secure attachment buffers depressionrelated complaints to a certain degree the functional emotion regulation of the securely attached better problem solving capacities enhanced by functional support seeking when needed may help them to prevent depression related complaints to occur or worsen insecure attachment and associated dysfunctional emotion regulation styles i e hyperactivation as in preoccupied attachment or deactivation as in dismissing avoidant attachment are associated with less favorable depression outcomes hyperactivation of emotions directly magnifies depressive complaints while associated clinging behavior might deter potential support givers resulting in less support deactivation or suppression of emotions may end in a rebounce of depressive complaints especially in the long run while avoidance behavior of potential caregivers results in less support further in line with earlier findings it became clear that the fearful avoidant group had the worst outcomes of all attachment groups consistent use of one insecure attachment strategy i e hyperactivation or deactivation is less worse than their alternation simpson and rholes describe the fearful avoidantly attached as enacting both strategies in a haphazard confused and chaotic manner resulting in an incoherent blend of contradictory abortive approach avoidance behaviors this makes fearful avoidantly attached less predictable for others which might further enhance relational problems the latter was reflected by the finding that their baseline score on loneliness was the highest among the attachment groups and their relational dysfunction was more severe than reported by the securely attached group presumably fearful avoidantly attached mobilize the lowest degree of support from others in combination with their less favorable baseline score on mastery compared with the secure group this suggests they experience severe coping difficulties that contribute to depression related complaints the more severe depression outcomes of the fearful avoidant group compared to in particular the secure group were not reflected in a significant higher duration of antidepressants usage one might speculate that fearful avoidant individuals experience particular discomfort asking for medical attention due to their approach avoidance tendencies limitations several limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings of this study first the sample size was limited resulting in some underpowered comparisons especially concerning categorical variables this makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the absence of differences second although we used the previously successfully applied cidi and life chart interviews these interviews were administered at one time point from which patients retrospectively looked back more than seven years in time it also warrants mentioning that over such a long follow up period it is possible that a person s attachment will change as a result of salient life events like different experiences with new relationships this may in turn affect the course of depression vice versa it may be that depression impacts relationship functioning and subsequently attachment quality third one may question whether the attachment measurement was not confounded by depressive complaints therefore we adjusted our analyses concerning depression severity by inclusion of severity of depression the month before completion of the attachment measurement as covariate although this adjustment yielded attenuated differences differences between the secure and fearful avoidant groups remained significant this finding is in line with previous research showing that attachment ratings are not affected by experimentally induced depressive mood conclusion and clinical implications we found that insecure attachment status predicted the course of depression outcomes even at a seven year follow up this observation supports the importance of attachment as a conceptual framework for understanding the unfavorable long term course of depression although treatment with antidepressants and individual psychotherapy like cbt positively affect the course of depression results remain suboptimal for example residual symptoms are often evident after individual treatment and such residual symptoms have been shown to be an important risk factor for relapse a systemic perspective may add to the understanding why people relapse after individual therapy although our data do not speak to this directly one may conjecture that once patients return to their systemic context of primary relationship family friends and colleagues they may slip into old enduring dysfunctional interaction patterns that are molded by their insecure attachment psychotherapy that pays attention to the systemic problems people experience may help them not only to function better on their own but also to relate better with others together this may further reduce unfavorable long term depression outcomes fig fig severity of depression during the seven year followup table demographic and clinical characteristics at the
