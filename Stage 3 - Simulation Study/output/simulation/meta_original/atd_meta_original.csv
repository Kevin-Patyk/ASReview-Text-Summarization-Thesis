238,Cognitive and affective trait and state factors influencing the long-term symptom course in remitted depressed patients,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a high risk for relapses and chronic developments. Clinical characteristics such as residual symptoms have been shown to negatively affect the long-term course of MDD. However, it is unclear so far how trait repetitive negative thinking (RNT) as well as cognitive and affective momentary states, the latter experienced during daily-life, affect the long-term course of MDD. METHOD: We followed up 57 remitted depressed (rMDD) individuals six (T2) and 36 (T3) months after baseline. Clinical outcomes were time to relapse, time spent with significant symptoms as a marker of chronicity, and levels of depressive symptoms at T2 and T3. Predictors assessed at baseline included residual symptoms and trait RNT. Furthermore, momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination, and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment (AA). RESULTS: In multiple models, residual symptoms and instability of daily-life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse, while chronicity was significantly predicted by trait RNT. Multilevel models revealed that depressive symptom levels during follow-up were predicted by baseline residual symptom levels and by instability of daily-life rumination. Both instability features were linked to a higher number of anamnestic MDD episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that trait RNT, but also affective and cognitive processes during daily life impact the longer-term course of MDD. Future longitudinal research on the role of respective AA-phenotypes as potential transdiagnostic course-modifiers is warranted.",10.1371/journal.pone.0178759,1,17.333333333333332
775,Negative Self-Referential Processing Predicts the Recurrence of Major Depressive Episodes,"Most individuals who develop major depressive disorder (MDD) will experience a recurrent depressive episode; we know little, however, about cognitive mechanisms that increase the likelihood of recurrence. In the current study we examined whether negatively biased self-referential processing, negative life events, baseline depressive symptoms, and psychotropic medication use predicted the onset of a subsequent depressive episode in a longitudinal study of women with a history of recurrent MDD. Higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted experiencing a greater number of negative life events, which, in turn, tended to predict recurrence of depression. It is important that after accounting for other associations, negatively biased self-referential processing contributed unique variance to the likelihood of experiencing a depressive episode over the next 3 years. Thus, negatively biased self-referential processing appears to be a significant risk factor for the recurrence of depressive episodes and may be an important target for interventions aimed at preventing future episodes.",10.1177/2167702616654898,1,39.333333333333336
865,Personality and cognitive vulnerability in remitted recurrently depressed patients,"INTRODUCTION: Personality disorders (PDs) have been associated with a poor prognosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The aim of the current study was to examine cognitive vulnerability (i.e., dysfunctional beliefs, extremity of beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination) that might contribute to this poor prognosis of patients with PD comorbidity. METHODS: 309 outpatients with remitted recurrent MDD (SCID-I; HAM-D17 \ \textless \ /= 10) were included within two comparable RCTs and were assessed at baseline with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4(+) (PDQ-4(+)), the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale Version-A (DAS-A), the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS), the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR). RESULTS: We found an indication that the PD prevalence was 49.5 \ \% \ in this remitted recurrently depressed sample. Having a PD (and higher levels of personality pathology) was associated with dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination. Extreme 'black and white thinking' on the DAS was not associated with personality pathology. Brooding was only associated with a Cluster C classification (t(308) = 4.03, p \ \textless \ .001) and with avoidant PD specifically (t(308) = 4.82, p \ \textless \ .001), while surprisingly not with obsessive-compulsive PD. LIMITATIONS: PDs were assessed by questionnaire and the analyses were cross-sectional in nature. CONCLUSION: Being the first study to examine cognitive reactivity and rumination in patients with PD and remitted MDD, we demonstrated that even after controlling for depressive symptomatology, dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive reactivity, and rumination were associated with personality pathology. Rumination might be a pathway to relapse for patients with avoidant PD. Replication of our findings concerning cognitive vulnerability and specific PDs is necessary.",10.1016/j.jad.2014.10.042,1,55.333333333333336
65,Adult attachment predicts the seven-year course of recurrent depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Attachment theory posits that attachment has a persistent, long-term impact on depression. Empirical data on associations between adult attachment and the long-term course of depression is, however, scarce. The present study addresses this omission. METHOD: Primary care patients with a history of depression (n = 103) completed the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire measuring adult attachment dimensions (avoidance and anxiety) and styles (secure, preoccupied, dismissing and fearful). The subsequent seven-year course of depression was assessed with the face-to-face administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and a life-chart interview based on the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). At the end of the seven-year follow-up severity of depression was additionally measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The attachment dimensions avoidance and anxiety both showed significant associations during the seven-year course with lower proportions of depressive symptom-free time and higher severity of depression (LIFE and BDI). The secure style predicted compared to preoccupied attachment a significantly higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 1.10 years), compared to dismissing attachment a higher proportion of symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 2.20 years) and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.14; BDI 6.04 vs. 9.52), and compared to fearful attachment a lower relapse/recurrence rate (45.7% vs. 76.9%), higher proportions of depression diagnosis-free time (7.31 vs. 6.65 years) and symptom-free time (4.97 vs. 0.29 years), and lower severity of depression (LIFE: 1.65 vs. 2.19; BDI 6.04 vs. 15.54). LIMITATIONS: Sample size was restricted. CONCLUSION: Insecure attachment predicts an unfavorable course of depression over a seven-year period.",10.1016/j.jad.2017.08.009,1,72.0
