In this notebook, we will see how to fine-tune one of the [ðŸ¤—`Transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) model for a summarization task. We will use the [PubMed Summarization dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ccdv/pubmed-summarization) which contains PubMed articles accompanied with abstracts.

## Loading the dataset

We will use the [ðŸ¤— `Datasets`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library to download the data and get the metric we need to use for evaluation (to compare our model to the benchmark). This can be easily done with the functions `load_dataset` and `load_metric`.

"""## Preprocessing the data

Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by a ðŸ¤— `Transformers` `Tokenizer` which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that the model requires.

To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method, which will ensure:

- we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
- we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.

That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.

"""By default, the call above will use one of the fast tokenizers (backed by Rust) from the ðŸ¤— `Tokenizers` library.

You can directly call this tokenizer on one sentence or a pair of sentences:
"""

tokenizer("Hello, this one sentence!")

"""Depending on the model you selected, you will see different keys in the dictionary returned by the cell above. They don't matter much for what we're doing here (just know they are required by the model we will instantiate later), you can learn more about them in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/preprocessing.html) if you're interested.

Instead of one sentence, we can pass along a list of sentences:
"""

tokenizer(["Hello, this one sentence!", "This is another sentence."])

"""To prepare the targets for our model, we need to tokenize them inside the `as_target_tokenizer` context manager. This will make sure the tokenizer uses the special tokens corresponding to the targets:"""

with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer():
    print(tokenizer(["Hello, this one sentence!", "This is another sentence."]))

"""We can then write the function that will preprocess our samples. We just feed them to the `tokenizer` with the argument `truncation=True`. This will ensure that an input longer that what the model selected can handle will be truncated to the maximum length accepted by the model. The padding will be dealt with later on (in a data collator) so we pad examples to the longest length in the batch and not the whole dataset.

The max input length of `sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-1` is 1024, so `max_input_length = 1024`.

This will apply the function on all the elements of all the splits in `dataset`, so our training, validation and testing data will be preprocessed in one single command."""

tokenized_datasets = raw_datasets.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

"""Even better, the results are automatically cached by the ðŸ¤— `Datasets` library to avoid spending time on this step the next time you run your notebook. The ðŸ¤— `Datasets` library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— `Datasets` warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

Note that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.

## Fine-tuning the model

Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since our task is of the sequence-to-sequence kind, we use the `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us.

"""Note that  we don't get a warning like in our classification example. This means we used all the weights of the pretrained model and there is no randomly initialized head in this case.

To instantiate a `Seq2SeqTrainer`, we will need to define three more things. The most important is the [`Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:

"""Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the cell and customize the weight decay. Since the `Seq2SeqTrainer` will save the model regularly and our dataset is quite large, we tell it to make three saves maximum. Lastly, we use the `predict_with_generate` option (to properly generate summaries) and activate mixed precision training (to go a bit faster).

The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"sgugger/t5-finetuned-xsum"` or `"huggingface/t5-finetuned-xsum"`).

Then, we need a special kind of data collator, which will not only pad the inputs to the maximum length in the batch, but also the labels:
"""

"""The last thing to define for our `Seq2SeqTrainer` is how to compute the metrics from the predictions. We need to define a function for this, which will just use the `metric` we loaded earlier, and we have to do a bit of pre-processing to decode the predictions into texts:"""
